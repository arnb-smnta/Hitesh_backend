wrap database connection in try catch because it always throws error

always use async - await function to connect data base because its in another continent it takes time to connect

We have to reload the server if there is a change in environement variable.

async method returns promise when called

app.use() it is used when we are configuration settings or using a middleware

(err,req,res,next) next is flag for middleware
